# Pareto Leg Hardware
This is a CAD snapshot (Solidworks 2020) of the Pareto Leg.

## Summary
This model is modeled "[Top-Down](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_Top-Down_Design_Overview.htm#:~:text=In%20top%2Ddown%20assembly%20design,moves%20down%20to%20the%20parts.)," where most of the structural parts are driven from parameters in a single part.
The advantage is that variables can be tweaked from one file, and the rest of the top assembly will resize to accommodate the changes.
The top assembly also contains several *Configurations* with predefined parameters that will resize the model to create a particular leg instance.

## Assembly Tools
You will need:
* 2mm Ball End Hex Key, [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/5497A52/)
* 2.5mm Ball End Hex Key, [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/5497A53/)
* 3mm Ball End Hex Key, [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/5497A54/)
* 7mm Hex Nut Driver, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQJ5ZY)
* Soldering iron (for installing heat set inserts)
